Pneumonia-Detection

### Project Overview
This project aims to address the pneumonia detection problem, a leading cause of respiratory illness and death worldwide, by using deep learning models to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The study leverages an ensemble of pre-trained models, including VGG-16, DenseNet121, and a custom CNN model, and employs advanced techniques like transfer learning, data augmentation, and explainability methods to improve detection accuracy. The project also integrates explainable AI (XAI) methods like Grad-CAM and LIME to provide transparency in the model's decision-making process, making it easier for healthcare professionals to understand how the model arrives at its conclusions. By combining these techniques, the project aims to provide an effective, reliable, and interpretable tool for pneumonia detection in clinical settings.

### Key Features
- **Dataset:** 5,840 chest X-ray images from Kaggle.
- **Models Used:** CNN, VGG-16 and DenseNet121.
- **Approach:** Applied XAI techniques such Grad-CAM and LIME to explain model prediction.
- **Deployment:** A user-friendly Streamlit-based web application for real-time predictions.


### Screenshots of Application
The chosen model (VGG-16) was deployed in a Streamlit web application, which allows users to upload X-ray images and receive predictions on Pneumonia classification.
